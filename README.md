#Caregiver Scheduling Program  

This program simplifies caregiver scheduling, first created to manage shifts for a 93-year-old requiring daily care.  

## Features  

1. **Caregiver Management**: Tracks caregiver details and availability (`Preferred`, `Available`, `Unavailable`).  
2. **Schedule Generation**: Creates schedules for two daily shifts (7:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 1:00 PM - 7:00 PM) based on availability and preferences.  
3. **HTML Calendar**: Uses Pythonâ€™s `calendar` module to display schedules visually.  
4. **Pay Calculation**: Calculates weekly pay for paid caregivers ($20/hour) and generates pay reports.  

## Technical Details  

- Built with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
- Designed for team collaboration with GitHub branches and version control.  

## How to Use  

1. Add caregivers and set their availability.  
2. Generate and view the monthly schedule.  
3. Review detailed pay reports.  

## Adaptability
